# Palalinux-Paladium-Launcher-for-Linux
**IMPORTANT : I'm not maintaining this as much as my other repos... Paladium devs literally just cut Linux support and that's not my job to do it.**
**Electron used for the launcher is compatible with LINUX**
**Minecraft AND Java ALSO.**
**They are just lazy so please let them know that you want a Linux version. That's not because we're a small number that we are supposed to be left off.**


Paladium-pvp working with Wine, expect some frame drops during the first minutes.
Just open a terminal in te folder with the files and run **sh install.sh** to install and **sh uninstall.sh** to uninstall

**Require wine installed on your distribution**
